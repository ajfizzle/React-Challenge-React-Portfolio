              I'm a passionate problem-solver with a diverse background in the
              world of technology. My journey began as a traditional deskside
              support which I transitioned to Application Support, where I honed
              my skills in troubleshooting, diagnosing, and resolving complex
              technical issues. I thrived in fast-paced environments, providing
              exceptional support to users of all technical levels.

              I constantly seek to learn and explore new technologies, staying
              abreast of the latest trends and advancements. I believe in the
              power of teamwork and leverage diverse perspectives to achieve
              optimal solutions.

              While my professional life revolves around technology, I believe
              in maintaining a healthy balance by enjoying activities such as
              cooking, watching soccer, football, hiking, biking and movies, and
              spending time with my spouse and our wonderful kids.
