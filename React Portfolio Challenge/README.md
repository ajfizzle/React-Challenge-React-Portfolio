## Description

This project is a single-page application portfolio built using React. It showcases the developer's projects and skills using the latest web technologies.

## User Story

As an employer looking for candidates with experience building single-page applications, I want to view a potential employee's deployed React portfolio of work samples so that I can assess whether they're a good candidate for an open position.

## Acceptance Criteria

- When loading the portfolio, the page includes a header, a section for content, and a footer.
- The header displays the developer's name and navigation with titles: About Me, Portfolio, Contact, and Resume. The current section title is highlighted.
- Clicking on a navigation title loads the corresponding section below the navigation without page reloading.
- The default selected section on first load is About Me.
- The About Me section includes a recent photo/avatar of the developer and a short bio.
- The Portfolio section displays titled images of six applications with links to both the deployed applications and their GitHub repositories.
- The Contact section includes a form with fields for name, email address, and message. It provides required field validation and email format validation.
- The Resume section includes a link to download the developer's resume and a list of proficiencies.
- The footer includes text or icon links to the developer's GitHub, LinkedIn, and a third platform profile (e.g., Stack Overflow, Twitter).
